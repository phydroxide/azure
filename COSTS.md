# Cost Analysis

I started this journey early in February and really didn't get around to anything until almost the end of February. For a period of time I left some resources running out of neglect.

Even still the cost I ran up was not unreasonable, and fell within the free credits Azure gave me.

At the end of my experiment I owe no money to Microsoft. Thank You Microsoft for the journey and the learning.
